### **Security Rules**
- All API endpoints must validate input data using Zod schemas

### **Database & API Rules**
- All database schemas must be defined in src/lib/db-schema.sql
- API routes must follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500)
- All API responses must follow consistent JSON structure

## üé® **Design System Rules**

### **Styling Guidelines**

- Test MCP integrations before committing

### **Amazon Q Developer Integration**
- Use mcp-amazon-q-optimized.json as primary configuration
- All prompts must follow Vibe Coding methodology
- Document significant AI-generated code sections
- Maintain 90%+ AI-generated code ratio

## üöÄ **Deployment & Infrastructure Rules**

### **Environment Configuration**
- All environment variables must be documented in .env.example
- Use different configurations for development, staging, production
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords) to repository
- All infrastructure must be defined as code (Terraform preferred)

### **AWS Infrastructure Standards**
- All S3 buckets must have encryption enabled and block public access
- All RDS instances must have encryption at rest enabled
- Use least privilege principle for all IAM roles and policies
- All resources must be tagged with project, environment, and owner

### **Cost Optimization Rules**
- Use AWS Free Tier resources for development and testing
- Document all infrastructure costs in deployment documentation
- Implement auto-scaling for production workloads
- Regular cost reviews and optimization recommendations

## üìä **Monitoring & Analytics Rules**

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Implement Web Vitals tracking on all pages
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Use proper logging for debugging (structured logs preferred)
- Implement health checks for all critical services

### **Error Handling Standards**

## üîÑ **Git & Version Control Rules**

### **Commit Standards**
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:)
- All commits must pass linting and tests before pushing
- Use meaningful branch names (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
- Squash commits before merging to main branch

### **Code Review Requirements**
- All code changes must be reviewed before merging
- Tests must pass and coverage must not decrease
- Documentation must be updated for new features
- Performance impact must be considered and documented
